## WSR maximization for RIS system

This repository contains the source codes of the Fig.4(b) in the paper ``Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Wireless Networks'' published in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications.

In the paper, BSUM algorithm is adopted which achieves a KKT solution for the MU-WSR problem. In addition, imperfect CSI issue is addressed by stochastic optimization.

## Introduction of the codes

### Plot fig.4(b)

Run the file ``converge_plot.m''. You may get the following figure

### Generate random channel

To generate one snapshot for simulation, one may run following three files in sequenceï¼š

+ ``generate_location.m'': Random the users' locations
+ ``generate_pathloss.m'': Calucate the pathloss according to the locations
+ ``generate_channel.m''" Randomly generate the channel realizations

### Main codes for the algorithms

The following are the main code files for the 5 algorihtms shown in the figure.

+ ``without_RIS.m'': There's no RIS in the system.
+ ``RIS_phaserand.m'': The RIS adopts random phase.
+ ``converge_AO_perfect.m'': Alternating optimization approach illustrated in Section III. Note that, to support the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm, one should download the Manopt toolbox from <https://www.manopt.org/> at first.
+ ``converge_A2_perfect.m'': Proposed algorithm under the perfect CSI setup.
+ ``converge_A2_imperfect.m'': Proposed algorithm under the imperfect CSI setup.

We propose a general IRS statistical CSI configuration algorithm, which can be adopted to any statistical CSI model even for the case when there is no LoS link between BS and IRS. One may refer the source code from <https://github.com/guohuayan/IRS_opt_statistical_CSI>
